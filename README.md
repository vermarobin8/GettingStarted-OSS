## About OSS

### What does “open source” mean?
When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly.
To understand how it works, imagine your friend is having a potluck, and you bring a cherry pie.
* Everybody tries the pie (use)
* The pie is a hit! They ask you for the recipe, which you provide (view)
* One friend, Alex, who’s a pastry chef, suggests reducing the sugar (modify)
* Another friend, Lisa, asks to use it for a dinner next week (distribute)

By comparison, a closed source process would be going to a restaurant and ordering a slice of cherry pie. You must pay a fee to eat the pie, and the restaurant probably won’t give you their recipe. If you copied their pie exactly and sold it under your own name, the restaurant could take action against you.

### Why do people opensource their work? 
There are many reasons why a person or organization would want to open source a project. Some examples include:
1. Collaboration: Open source projects can accept changes from anybody in the world. Exercism, for example, is a programming exercise platform with over 350 contributors.
2. Adoption and remixing: Open source projects can be used by anyone for nearly any purpose. People can even use it to build other things. WordPress, for example, started as a fork of an existing project called b2.
3. Transparency: Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors or inconsistencies. Transparency matters to governments like Bulgaria or the United States, regulated industries like banking or healthcare, and security software like Let’s Encrypt.

### How to contribute to other projects?
If your goal is to learn how to collaborate with others or understand how open source works, consider contributing to an existing project. Start with a project that you already use and love. Contributing to a project can be as simple as fixing typos or updating documentation.

### Finding people for your own opensource project
Consider creating a website for your project. A website makes your project friendlier and easier to navigate, especially paired with clear documentation and tutorials. It also suggests that your project is active, which will make your audience feel more comfortable using it. Use examples to give people ideas for how to use your project.If your project is hosted on GitHub, you can use GitHub Pages to easily make a website. Yeoman, Vagrant, and Middleman are a few examples of excellent, comprehensive websites.
